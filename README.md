## Olympiads:
I'm a dedicated problem-solver with a passion for software development. 
I've participated in Olympiads in mathematics (3rd degree diploma at the 
national mathematics Olympiad and 1st and 2nd degrees at the regional 
mathematics Olympiad), informatics and physics, which have sharpened my 
analytical and critical thinking skills.
